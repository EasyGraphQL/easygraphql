[`easygraphql`](https://github.com/EasyGraphQL) is an open source project that's is
composed of some GraphQL tools, focused on the minimum configuration possible to use them,
so you can spend much of your time coding things that create value for your project and 
no building configurations.

[`easygraphql`](https://github.com/EasyGraphQL) was created after having the need of
a GraphQL tool to make tests of the queries and mutations; the main idea is to continue
developing new tools that can be useful and the most important thing, creating GraphQL
community.

If you want to join [`easygraphql`](https://github.com/EasyGraphQL), you're much than
welcome, this project is open source and everybody can continue improving the actual
tools and developing new tools.
